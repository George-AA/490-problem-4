# 490-problem-4
problem 4 for problem set 3

This code applies feed forward neural network on a dataset for air-bnb stock prices taken from hugging face. Because there are many different criteria such as open stock prices, closed stock prices, etc. I chose to apply this test on the closed stock prices.

The code uses necessary libraries such as  including numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn for training and reading data. I split the data into training set and test set. After that, I implemented the neural network class
and trained it to make prediction and to further evaluate the model.
